Release 1.1.2
=============

 * Switch to 16bit implementation for 64bit LispWorks 8, to avoid
   compiler optimization problems in keccak-state-merge-input, and
   also slightly higher performance due to non-consing.

Release 1.1.1
=============

 * Fix a bug in pad-message-to-width on ACL, which would lead to
   completely erroneous results being calculated for all inputs
   due to differences in the result of adjust-array between ACL
   and all other currently supported implementations.

Release 1.1.0
=============

 * Change sha3 functions to match the final FIPS 202 SHA3 standard,
   by appending a 01 suffix to messages prior to digest calculation.
   The old Keccak submission behavior can be retained by passing in
   the new raw-keccak-p keyword argument with true to the relevant
   functions.  Thanks to David McClain for prompting this change.

 * Fixes a bug in the bug fix of release 1.0.2 for the sha3-update
   handling of not completely filled buffers reported by David McClain,
   which could lead to out-of-bounds accesses in calls to the
   pad-message-to-width function.

Release 1.0.2
=============

 * Fixes a bug reported by Orivej Desh where two or more calls to
   sha3-update which didn't fill the buffer could lead to the second
   and later updates being ignored, thereby creating wrong message
   digests.

Release 1.0.1
=============

 * Change to 32bit implementation for 64bit LispWorks.

Release 1.0.0
=============

 * Initial release with optimized versions for 64bit, 32bit and
   fixnum arithmetic.
